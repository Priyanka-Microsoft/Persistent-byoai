In another study ,Tang et al. (2020) found that compared with H1N1 patients ,COVID-19 patients are more likely to develop nonproductive coughsaccompanied by obvious constitutional symptoms,such as fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. One recent study suggested that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can cause multisystem lesions (Tersalvi et al., 2020). Potential hypogonadism and attention should be paid to the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the reproductive system (Fan et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020). Skin is one of the target organs affected by COVID-19 infection ,and a total of 5.3% of patients developed a rash before they developed any symp‐toms (Li HX et al., 2020). Influenza can also be characterized by a variety of systemic symptoms including high fever ,chills , headache ,myalgia ,discomfort ,and anorexia as well as respiratory symptoms including cough ,congestion , and sore throat .The most common symptoms are high fever and cough ,occurring in 60%‒80% of cases .

The outbreak of COVID-19 began in December 2019, at the same time as the influenza season. However, as the treatments and prognoses of COVID-19 and influenza are different, it is important to accuratelydifferentiate these two different respiratory tract infections on the basis of their respective early-stage characteristics. Wereviewed official documents and news released by the National Health Commission of the People ’s Republic of China, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), the United States CDC, and the World Health Organization(WHO), and we also searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica database (Embase), China National KnowledgeInfrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, preprinted bioRxiv and medRxiv databases for documents and guidelines from earliest available date up until October 3rd, 2020. We obtained the latest information about COVID-19 and influenza and summarizedand compared their biological characteristics, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathological mechanisms, treatments, and prognostic factors. We show that although COVID-19 and influenza are different in many ways, there are numerous similarities;thus, in addition to using nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody-based approaches, clinicians and epidemiologists should distinguish between the two using their respective characteristics in early stages. We should utilizeexperiences from other epidemics to provide additional guidance for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Key words: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Influenza; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1 Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first identified at the end of 2019. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) as‐sessed initial patients and identified a novel corona ‐ virus, which was later named 2019 novel coronavi ‐ rus (2019-nCoV). Later, on February 11th, 2020, theWorld Health Organization (WHO) officially namedthis disease COVID-19, while the International Vi‐rus Classification Committee identified the pathogenas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) (Tan WJ et al., 2020). COVID-19poses a threat to global public health and is a chal ‐ lenge to the whole people, government, and society (Shi et al., 2020).The outbreak of COVID-19 began in December 2019, corresponding to the influenza season. It is important for clinicians to distinguish COVID-19from other respiratory infections, including influenza.One study showed that the global number of respiratoryinfluenza-related deaths was between 290 000 and 650 000 per year (Iuliano et al., 2018), while another study showed that the global number of deaths fromlower respiratory tract infections directly caused byinfluenza was between 99 000 and 200 000 per year(GBD 2017 Influenza Collaborators, 2019)","id":null,"title":"Comparison of COVID-19 and influenza characteristics.","filepath":"33615750.pdf_00_01","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7885750/#page=0","metadata":null,"image_mapping":null,"chunk_id":"0"},{"content":"Niquini RP et al.2 Cad. Saúde Pública 2020; 36(7):e00149420 Introduction The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was confirmed on February 26, 2020, in the State of São Paulo. Social distancing measures were only implemented in the state nearly a month later 1, contributing to the rapid spread of the disease in the state and in Brazil. Shortly more than a month after confirma - tion of the first case, all 26 states and the Federal District already had ten or more cases each, with the heaviest concentration in the Southeast region (62.5%), followed by the Northeast (15.4%), South (10.8%), Central (6.6%), and North (4.7%) 2. Brazil’s reality is heterogeneous, both in the epidemic’s evolution and in access to healthcare 3, since the country has continental dimensions, with different population distribution patterns, trans - portation conditions (roadways, availability, and costs), income inequalities, and education 4. By the month of May, the states of Rio de Janeiro, Amazonas, Ceará, Pará, and Pernambuco were already facing critical situations, especially in the respective state capitals and metropolitan areas, overload - ing the health system 5,6, while in other states the disease was spreading more slowly. The disease has gradually spread from the state capitals into the interior, a phenomenon that could impact the country’s health system even more heavily, since many municipalities (counties) lack even a single hospital, and the population is forced to seek health treatment in the regional hub cities 7,8 (Ministério da Saúde. Painel coronavírus. https://covid.saude.gov.br, accessed on May/2020). Despite the increasing number of municipalities with cases and the growing number of hospi - talizations and deaths from COVID-19 in Brazil (Ministério da Saúde. Painel coronavírus. https:// covid.saude.gov.br, accessed on May/2020) there is still limited information for characterizing the hospitalized cases in Brazil (as elsewhere in the world). Studies in China, Italy, and the United States have analyzed the profile of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and found high prevalence of elderly individuals, males, and preexisting comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes 9,10,11 . In order to monitor hospitalized COVID-19 cases in Brazil, the Ministry of Health incorporated testing for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) into surveillance of the severe acute respi - ratory illness (SARI). Case notification is compulsory, and the records are stored in the SIVEP-Gripe (Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System) database 12,13. The system was created during the influenza H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and has been maintained since then to monitor SARI cases and for the surveillance of unusual events associated with this syndrome in the country. Among the cases of hospitalization for SARI reported to the national surveillance system from 2010 to 2019, the infectious agents according to the predominant laboratory test in each season were influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)","id":null,"title":"Description and comparison of demographic characteristics and comorbidities in SARI from COVID-19, SARI from influenza, and the Brazilian general population.","filepath":"32725087.pdf_01_01","url":"https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/Zgn3W4jYm6nZpCNt98K6Sdv/?lang=en#page=1","metadata":null,"image_mapping":null,"chunk_id":"0"},{"content":"COMPARISON OF SARI CASES DUE TO COVID-19 IN THE BRAZILIAN POPULATION9 Cad. Saúde Pública 2020; 36(7):e00149420 18 to 39 years and for all adults. However, among patients hospitalized for SARI-FLU, possibly due to the above-mentioned limitation, it was not possible to show the association between CVD and hos - pitalization for influenza (which has been reported elsewhere in the literature) 15. Thus, importantly, the difference between the prevalence rates of CVD in the general population and in hospitalizations for SARI must be greater in all the age groups analyzed. Finally, another important limitation was the potential bias in the completion and recording of the case notification forms, a bias that is inherent to any study based on data from information systems without direct case-by-case follow-up in the hospital network. On the other hand, the use of data on hospitalizations for SARI-COVID obtained from the SIVEP-Gripe database allows an analysis of a larger population and is extremely relevant for monitoring the profile of severe cases of the disease in the country. In short, the current study corroborates the literature on more advanced age, male gender, and comorbidities as factors associated with hospitalization for COVID-19, which can be considered a marker for severity of the disease. Compared to the Brazilian general population, the high proportion of elderly patients and those 40 to 59 years of age and/or with comorbidities (diabetes, CVD, CKD, and chronic lung diseas - es) among patients hospitalized for SARI-COVID indicates that these patients may be present - ing more serious cases of the disease. This hypothesis should be confirmed through longitudinal studies to support public health policies, for example, defining these risk groups as a priority for vaccination campaigns. Contributors R. P.

Saúde Pública 2020; 36(7):e00149420 Discussion The concentration of hospitalizations for SARI-COVID in the Southeast of Brazil reflects the fact that the disease first reached the country in the State of São Paulo, followed by Rio de Janeiro. Social dis - tancing measures were not implemented evenly in the states of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro launched social distancing measures on March 13, while São Paulo only adopted them nearly a month after confirma - tion of the first case, which contributed to the rapid spread of the disease both in the state and in the country as a whole 1. Some three months after identification of the first case of COVID-19 in Brazil, 26% (62,345) of the cases and 30% (4,782) of the deaths from the disease were recorded in São Paulo. The other three states of the Southeast region accounted for 14% of the cases and 20% of the deaths 18. The higher percentage of residents in the South of Brazil among patients hospitalized for SARI-FLU (22%) when compared to residents of the South as a proportion of the total Brazilian popu - lation (14%) is consistent with the fact that the South is the only region of Brazil with a subtropical climate (as opposed to tropical), which favors the higher incidence of influenza there 19. The median age of patients hospitalized for SARI-COVID was similar to that of patients hospital - ized in Wuhan, China (56, IQR: 46-67) 9 and lower than that of patients hospitalized in New York in the United States (63, IQR: 52-75) 11 and in those admitted to intensive care units in Lombardy, Italy (63, IQR: 56-70) 10. The differences can be explained by the age profiles of the general population in the respective countries. The Brazilian and Chinese populations have lower proportions of individu - als 60 years or older (14% and 17%, respectively), compared to the United States and Italy (23% and 30%, respectively) (United Nations. World population prospects 2019. Estimates: 1950-2020. https:// population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/, accessed on 19/May/2020). The higher proportion of male patients among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 also appeared in the above-mentioned studies in China 9 and the United States 11, with an even higher percentage in patients admitted to intensive care units in Lombardy (82%) 10. Since males account for approxi - mately half of the population in these countries (United Nations. World population prospects 2019. Estimates: 1950-2020. https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/, accessed on 19/May/2020) the current study’s findings and the available scientific literature point to male gender as associated with more serious evolution of the disease and death 20. There is no evidence in the international literature of any race or color at greater risk of hospital - ization for seasonal influenza 15. Thus, the higher relative frequency of self-identified whites among Brazilians hospitalized for SARI-FLU may reflect the higher proportion of hospitalized patients among individuals in the South (which has a proportionally larger white population than the rest of Brazil)","id":null,"title":"Description and comparison of demographic characteristics and comorbidities in SARI from COVID-19, SARI from influenza, and the Brazilian general population.","filepath":"32725087.pdf_06_01","url":"https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/Zgn3W4jYm6nZpCNt98K6Sdv/?lang=en#page=6","metadata":null,"image_mapping":null,"chunk_id":"0"}],"intent":"[\\"What is COVID-19?\\", \\"Tell me about COVID-19\\", \\"COVID-19 explained\\"]"}',
